The process used to make a Camembert will be similar to, but not quite the same as, that used to make Cheddar.\\n\\nSome cheeses may be deliberately left to ferment from naturally airborne spores and bacteria; this approach generally leads to a less consistent product but one that is valuable in a niche market.\\n\\nCulturing\\nCheese is made by bringing milk (possibly pasteurised) in the cheese vat to a temperature required to promote the growth of the bacteria that feed on lactose and thus ferment the lactose into lactic acid.

       "'Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don\\'t know the answer, just say that you don\\'t know, don\\'t try to make up an answer.\\n\\n\"Thomas Jefferson (April 13, 1743 \\\\u2013 July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, diplomat, lawyer, architect, philosopher, and Founding Father who served as the third president of the United States from 1801 to 1809. Among the Committee of Five charged by the Second Continental Congress with authoring the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson was the Declaration\\'s primary author. Following the American Revolutionary War and prior to becoming the nation\\'s third president in 1801, Jefferson was the first United States secretary of state under George Washington and then the nation\\'s second vice president under John Adams.\"\\n\\n\"Washington played an indispensable role in adopting and ratifying the Constitution of the United States, which replaced the Articles of Confederation in 1789 and remains the world\\'s longest-standing written and codified national constitution to this day. He was then twice elected president by the Electoral College unanimously. As the first U.S. president, Washington implemented a strong, well-financed national government while remaining impartial in a fierce rivalry that emerged between cabinet members Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. During the French Revolution, he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while sanctioning the Jay Treaty. He set enduring precedents for the office of president, including use of the title \\\\\"Mr. President\\\\\" and taking an Oath of Office with his hand on a Bible. His Farewell Address on September 19, 1796, is widely regarded as a preeminent statement on republicanism.\"\\n\\n\"Marcus Morton (1784 \\\\u2013 February 6, 1864) was an American lawyer, jurist, and politician from Taunton, Massachusetts. He served two terms as Governor of Massachusetts and several months as Acting Governor following the death in 1825 of William Eustis. He served for 15 years as an associate justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, all the while running unsuccessfully as a Democrat for governor. He finally won the 1839 election, acquiring exactly the number of votes required for a majority win over Edward Everett. After losing the 1840 and 1841 elections, he was elected in a narrow victory in 1842.\\\\n\\\\nThe Massachusetts Democratic Party was highly factionalized, which contributed to Morton\\'s long string of defeats. His brief periods of ascendancy, however, resulted in no substantive Democratic-supported reforms, since the dominant Whigs reversed most of the changes enacted during his terms. An opponent of the extension of slavery, he split with longtime friend John C.\\n\\n\"Muskets with interchangeable locks caught the attention of Thomas Jefferson through the efforts of Honor\\\\u00e9 Blanc when Jefferson was Ambassador to France in 1785. Jefferson tried to persuade Blanc to move to America, but was not successful, so he wrote to the American Secretary of War with the idea, and when he returned to the USA he worked to fund its development. President George Washington approved of the idea, and by 1798 a contract was issued to Eli Whitney for 12,000 muskets built under the new system.\"\\n\\nQuestion: Who is Thomas Jefferson?\\nHelpful Answer: Thomas Jefferson was an American statesman, diplomat, lawyer, architect, philosopher, and Founding Father who served as the third president of the United States from 1801 to 1809. He was the primary author of the Declaration of Independence and served as the first United States secretary of state under George Washington and then the nation\\'s second vice president under John Adams.\\n\\n- Response: Thomas Jefferson was a multifaceted individual who played several key roles in the early history of the United States. Born on April 13, 1743, he was deeply involved in the political and intellectual life of his country. As a statesman and diplomat, Jefferson represented American interests abroad and was instrumental in shaping the nation\\'s foreign policy.\\n\\nOne of Jefferson\\'s most significant contributions to American history was his role as a Founding Father. He was a leading figure in the movement for independence from Great Britain and was a member of the Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence in 1776. Jefferson was the principal author of this seminal document, which articulated the colonies\\' reasons for seeking independence and expressed the Enlightenment ideals of individual liberty and government by consent of the governed.\\n\\nJefferson\\'s political career continued to flourish after the American Revolution. He served as the first United States secretary of state under President George Washington, where he worked to establish the new nation\\'s foreign policy and diplomatic relations. Following this, he became the second vice president under President John Adams.\\n\\nIn 1801, Jefferson was elected as the third president of the United States. His presidency was marked by the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the size of the United States, and the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which explored the newly acquired western territory. Jefferson was also an advocate for the separation of church and state and the expansion of civil liberties.\\n\\nDespite his many accomplishments, Jefferson\\'s presidency was not without controversy. His Embargo Act of 1807, which aimed to protect American interests by prohibiting American ships from trading with foreign nations, was widely unpopular and hurt the U.S. economy. Nevertheless, Jefferson\\'s impact on the United States was profound, and his legacy as a champion of democracy and human rights endures.\\n\\nJefferson\\'s life and work exemplify the ideals of the Enlightenment and the American Revolution. His vision for a nation based on liberty, equality, and democratic governance has left an indelible mark on the history of the United States. Thomas Jefferson passed away on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, a fitting end to a life dedicated to the founding principles of the nation.'"

His advisor Lu Su secured an alliance with Liu Bei, himself a recent refugee from the north, and Zhou Yu was placed in command of Sun Quan's navy, along with a veteran general who served the Sun family, Cheng Pu.

      "- response: Sun Yat-sen was a Chinese revolutionary and political leader often referred to as the \"Father of the Nation\" in the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the \"forerunner of democratic revolution\" in the People's Republic of China. He played a crucial role in overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, the last imperial dynasty of China, and was instrumental in the founding of the Republic of China in 1912. Sun Yat-sen is best known for his \"Three Principles of the People\" (San Min Chu I), which aimed to make China a free, prosperous, and powerful nation. These principles were nationalism (to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and end foreign domination), democracy (to create a democratic government), and the people's livelihood (to ensure economic and social welfare for the people). Despite his efforts and significant impact on Chinese history, Sun Yat-sen's life was cut short when he was assassinated in 1925. His legacy continues to influence Chinese politics and society.\n"
