They may lose colour or get darker with age. Raised moles can be caused by elevation or evolution, where the mole becomes raised after being flat or changes over a short period of time. Moles can also lighten or darken in color and even disappear altogether[3]. However, drastic changes or raised moles could be an indication of melanoma, so it’s important to seek advice from a skin cancer specialist[4].
